								Space is for everyone
							</h2>
							<p>
								We want to go into space, and we want you to come with us. The cost of orbital launch is extremely prohibitive currently and there is no sign that we will see a dramatic decrease in the cost. Privatization of space travel has done much to reduce the cost of orbital launches, however with prices still in the thousands of dollars per kilogram the cost to put something into space becomes extreme quickly.

							<h2>
								Orbital vs Suborbital
							</h2>
							<p>
								When we talk about space launches we are talking about orbital launches, not suborbital. You can't just go straight up 100 miles because you won't stay there, you'll fall right back down. That is a sub-orbital launch, where the craft reaches an altitude which is high enough to be in space but it does not have the velocity to keep itself in space, thus it falls back after a small ammount of time. Sattilites and the ISS are all examples of orbital launches, where these objects orbit the earth and do not fall back down. The fact that they stay up allows them to do much more meaningful work in space. Who wants to spend all that energy to get into space just to come back after 10 minutes?

							<h2>
								Rockets are so 1950s
							</h2>
							<p>
								The reason that the price is so outrageous is because rockets are an inheretly limited techonology. The limitation is on the rocket fuel itself, there is only so much energy you can chemically store in fuel. Advances in composites, in turbopumps and computers can only help so much before you are faced with the raw fact that rocket fuel has not changed drastically since the days of Apollo. Most of the energy of the craft is into transporting its fuel and only a small percent is payload, with some or all of the vessel being discarded after launch. How expensive would it be to visit your relatives if after you drove to the next town you had to throw away your car?

								 recieved his Ph.D. in Theoretical Nuclear and Particle physics from Penn State in 2012. He currently works as a programmer and data scientist at We-Care.com. He is an accomplished bladesmith and has several technology and scientific startup companies currently in the works. When Sol Corp succeeds it is pretty much because of him.

							<p>
								got his Ph.D. in comsology and particle physics from the University of Deleware in 2012. Currently he teaches physics at some community college which he is too good for, so we're not sure why he is still there. Josh can be reached by email at josh@solcorporation.com

								Wells is still trying to get a Ph.D. in atomic molecular and optical physics from Penn State. One day we hope he'll do it, until then he is catching up on a lot of science fiction reading as well as setting new speed records for how quickly he can grade student's papers.
