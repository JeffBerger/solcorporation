ReportLab
DOCS is where I was doing all of my tests, for no particular reason and I 
didn't want to clean everything up, I'd rather just get you guys this right 
now.

Okay so the files that I think are most useful at this point are:

multi_test_stable.py
mongo_test.py

These are files I wrote to produce what we have right now.  Most of the other
python files with stupid names are mine, but were used as incremental tests.
I have already compiled the various pdf documents, there should be 3 of the 
form: reportlab-something.pdf

Other guide info can be found in TESTS in the file:
test-pedgen-general.py and .pdf

I like to look at the code that produces the pdf.  

I'm going through and making some comments now.  follow the basic installation
guides, either found online or in the reportlab pdf docs in the DOCS folder.

The best online examples I have found are at the following websites.
